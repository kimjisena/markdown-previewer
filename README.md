## Markdown Previewer

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO).

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

1. I can see a textarea element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.

2. I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.

3. When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.

7. Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as `br` (line break) elements.
